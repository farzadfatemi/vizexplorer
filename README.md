# Java Developer Programming Challenge
A set of Java coding tasks to assess Java programming and design skills.

## Overview
The following is a simple Java project which does nothing. The project has a number of known issues, some bugs and many other shortcomings. 

## Goals
* The three open issues should be resolved in separate pull requests.
* Each Pull request must be based on the same (initial) version of the code as at the HEAD of master.
* Any other bugs or shortcomings encountered may be fixed and/or documented on a page in the wiki, submitted as part of a pull request. If a fix is not part of the submission the problem should be described and a solution proposed.

## Constraints
* It is expected that the tasks can be completed within a couple of hours but the Pull requests must be submitted within 24 hours.

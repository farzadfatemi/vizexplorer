# Java Developer Programming Challenge
A set of Java coding tasks to assess Java programming and design skills.

## Overview
The following is a simple Java project which does nothing. The project has a number of known issues, some undocumented bugs and many other shortcomings. 

## Goals
* The three open issues should be resolved in separate pull requests.
* Each Pull request must be based on the same (initial) version of the code as at the HEAD of master, such that they can be accepted independently of one another.
* Make improvements to the existing code not covered in any issue. There are areas of the code that may have bugs or could be improved by refactoring. Submit pull requests with descriptions that describe the problem and your solution.

## Constraints
* It is expected that the tasks can be completed within a couple of hours but the Pull requests must be submitted within 24 hours.
* Observe the coding convensions in the legacy code and emulate those in any code you submit.

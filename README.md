# Java Developer Programming Challenge
A set of Java coding tasks to assess Java programming and design skills. This document outlines how to build and use the application and what is required for the challenge.

## Build
To build the application, clone and execute a standard maven build on the master branch. This will produce a jar file in the target folder.

## Usage
The application has a simple command line interface which is run using a java -jar command on the jar file produced in the build step above.

## Overview of the Challenge
The following is a simple Java project which does nothing. The project has a number of known issues, some undocumented bugs and many other non-functional issues with respect to robustness and usability which could be improved.

## Goals
* The three open issues should be resolved in separate pull requests.
* Each Pull request must be based on the same (initial) version of the code as at the HEAD of master, such that they can be accepted independently of one another.
* Make improvements to the existing code not covered in any issue. There are areas of the code that may have bugs or could be improved by refactoring. Submit pull requests with descriptions that describe the problem and your solution.

## Constraints
* It is expected that the tasks can be completed within a couple of hours but the Pull requests must be submitted within 24 hours.
* Observe the coding convensions in the legacy code and emulate those in any code you submit.
